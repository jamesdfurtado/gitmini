# GitMini
A lightweight CLI version control system built in Python that performs core Git commands-- created from scratch.

As of right now, to run commands, you do:

"python -m gitmini <command>"

and to run unit tests, we can do:

"python -m unittest discover tests"

Currently, this tests for the handling of gitmini and each subcommand, as well as its --help functionality.
